This journal article presents a novel SLAM system that integrates deep learning-based loop closure detection to improve mapping accuracy and consistency. Our method combines traditional geometric approaches with learned image features to detect loop closures more reliably in challenging environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
