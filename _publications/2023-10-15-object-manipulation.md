This work presents a novel approach to robot manipulation using vision-based deep imitation learning. Our method allows robots to learn complex manipulation tasks from human demonstrations captured through RGB-D cameras. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various manipulation tasks including grasping, pick-and-place, and assembly operations.
