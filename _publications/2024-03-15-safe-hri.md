We present a framework for safe human-robot interaction that integrates human motion prediction with adaptive motion planning. Our system ensures safety by maintaining appropriate separation distances while enabling efficient collaboration. The approach has been validated in real-world scenarios including collaborative assembly and assistive tasks.

**Keywords:** Human-Robot Interaction, Safety, Motion Planning, Predictive Control
