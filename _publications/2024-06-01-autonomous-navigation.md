This paper addresses the challenge of autonomous navigation in environments with dynamic obstacles. We propose a deep reinforcement learning framework that enables robots to learn adaptive navigation strategies through interaction with the environment. Our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional methods in both simulation and real-world experiments.
